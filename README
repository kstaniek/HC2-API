HC2 PHP API
Klaudiusz Staniek - kstaniek at gmail.com

Minimal interface to control Z-Wave appliances over Fibaro HC2.
It can be installed directly on HC2 (need to get the root access which is quite easy - please don't ask me how)
It uses port 4420/tcp to communicate with FibaroServer process running on HC2.

-- Features:
- Controlling Fibaro FGS221
- Controlling Fibaro DFG211
- Controlling Fibaro FGS211	- not tested

-- Requirements:
- webserver with php or run directly on HC2

-- Install:
- copy all files into your apache www directory.
- modify the first lines of index.php to fit your configuration - update the IP address of HC2
- open it in browser, you're done

-- Usage:
http://hc2/index.php?command=hc2_set_module_power&id=<id>&value=<value>	- set power to <value> for module with ID = <id> 

				for on/off module value=0 means off and value set to any non zero means on


-- Todo:
More commands to control other appliances through HC.
Setting the parameters of the appliances.
Polling the appliances.
